Task 1
Create a function in JavaScript that takes an array as an argument and returns the number of even and odd elements in the array, including zero, in the following format: "Even: x, Odd: y, Zero: z". The function should also handle arrays that contain non-numeric elements, such as null, undefined, and strings. Choose a descriptive name for the function and make sure to analyze its syntax.
Task 2 â€¨Write a function that takes any number (but not greater than 1,000), determines whether it is prime or not, and outputs a message indicating whether the number is prime or not. If a number greater than 1,000 is entered, a message is displayed stating that the data is invalid. Pay attention to the numbers 0 and 1.
Task 3
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a function that also takes a number as an argument and returns the sum of these two numbers. Output the result to the console.
Task 4
Write a function that takes two numbers. Every second, it is necessary to output to the console, starting from the first number and ending with the second. Use setInterval.
For example, if the user enters the numbers 5 and 15, the console should print a number starting from 5 and ending with 15 every second  (a total of 11 numbers: 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15).
Task 5
Write a function that takes two natural numbers x and n and returns x to the power of n. In other words, it multiplies x by itself n times and returns the result.
Use Arrow Function syntax.
Test the function with any values and print out the result to the console.
